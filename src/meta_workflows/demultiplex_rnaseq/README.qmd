title: A meta workflow for demultiplexing and RNA sequencing analysis
format: gfm
---

# Introduction

To perform demultiplexing and analysis of RNAseq data, we will create a meta workflow that includes the demultiplex and rnaseq workflows from Viash Hub. 

1. Start by creating a new workflow configuration with all the necessary inputs and outputs.
2. Add the demultiplex and rnaseq workflows as dependencies in the configuration.
3. Create the Nextflow script for the workflow.
4. Add the demultiplex and rnaseq workflows as steps in the Nextflow workflow.
5. Add any intermediate steps that are required to gather output fastq files from the demultiplex workflow and modify the state as required by the rnaseq workflow. 

# Test data
We will use the same test data that was used in the demultiplex workflow (TODO: add link). The genome reference files were obtained from <https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/tree/modules/data/genomics/sarscov2/genome>.
